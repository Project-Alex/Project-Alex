# Welcome to my GitHub!
Thank you for visiting!  
Hopefully this shows a little bit of what I'm about.  

## Currently learning...
Currently I am just learning more and more code. 
  
I have just finished a coding course from HyperionDev so,  
-- having (mostly) familiarised myself with Python --  
I am now working on C# and Java which are both really interesting.   

## Currently working on...
Entirely focused on securing a full-time job in Software Engineering which I am very excited about.
