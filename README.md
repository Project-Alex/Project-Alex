# Welcome to my GitHub!
Thank you for visiting!  
  
Hopefully it shows a little bit of what I'm about.  

RE: the lack of commits lately, I am just finishing a coding course from HyperionDev  
as well as a massive marketing contract, so all the time I've had set aside for finishing  
that will go into my portfolio very soon.

## Currently learning...
Currently focusing on C#.  
  
The asics are done, now  moving onto bigger things and getting something  
good up on here.  

I just need a couple more hours in the day - 26 or 28 would be ideal!

## Currently working on...
Entirely focused on securing a full-time job in Software Engineering which I am very excited about.  

## Other...
Aside from coding which I am transitioning into,  
I also work (or have worked) with:
- Marketing
- Sales
- Training and Development
- IT and Databases
- Website development
- Music production and content creation

Hence the move into coding.
