# Welcome to my GitHub!
Thank you for visiting!  
Hopefully this shows a little bit of what I'm about.  

## Currently learning...
Currently focusing on C#. Basics are done, now onto bigger things and getting something  
good up on here.  

I just need a couple more hours in the day - 26 or 28 would be ideal!
  
I have just finished a coding course from HyperionDev so,  
-~- having (mostly) familiarised myself with Python -~-  
I am now working on C# and Java which are both really interesting.   

## Currently working on...
Entirely focused on securing a full-time job in Software Engineering which I am very excited about.
